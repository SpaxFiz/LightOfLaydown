"Juan" come out from a lot of industry, not just in school, especially internet/financial, even now from national institutions. 

In this circumstance, a cluster of people thinking that why can't we live more easily, get more freedom, bear less pressure. We would like to call that will as "lie down flat" which against "juan".


So I make this project to provide financial data for personal reference and I hope I can grab something from the market.
